3. A web app which consumes data from the store
Tasks:
1. A web app which generates data
• This is a simple application which generates a mock page view event each
time you click the button.
• Enhance the full-stack-test application to send the event data to a remote data store
each time a page view event occurs.
• Deploy this application so it is publicly accessible.
2. A remote data store
• Create and deploy a remote data store to house the data from the provider app.
• Create and deploy a method of writing data to and reading data from the store.
3. A web app which consumes data from the store
• Create a web application which fetches page view events from your remote data
store and lists them in a table.
• Provide a mechanism to update the table as new events occur. This can be
automatic or triggered by a user action.
• Deploy this application so it is publicly accessible.
